      <h1>About Our Recipe App</h1>
      <p>
         Our recipe app is a vibrant celebration of Kenyan cuisine, offering a diverse array of dishes that reflect the rich tapestry of flavors influenced by various cultures and regions. From the hearty staple of Ugali, a dense cornmeal porridge perfect for scooping up stews, to the smoky tenderness of Nyama Choma, Swahili for "grilled meat," our app brings the essence of Kenyan cooking to your kitchen. Discover the simplicity and depth of Kenyan stews, which combine meats like beef, goat, or chicken with a tomato base and a fragrant "mchuzi mix" of spices, and explore the freshness of Kachumbari, a tangy chopped salad that adds a refreshing touch to any meal.
